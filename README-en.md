# Cthulhu Game

This game was initially made in REACT with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It was then improved with redux and integrated into symphony.

## ðŸ›  Objectives

- Creating a TicTacToe game using React.
- Understand and use the fundamental concepts of React and Redux, state management, props and components.
- Use hooks.
- Use named imports/exports (instead of default imports/exports).
- Integrating the React app into a symfony application.

####  API REST :

- The api follows the REST structure (https://restfulapi.net/) and is in JSON format.
- Choice to create a new player at the beginning of the game or to reuse an existing one.
- Presence of a scoreboard in a new view with a route, which lists the players with :
   - the number of games won,
   - the number of games played,
   - the date of the last activity.
   - and a podium of the 3 best players.
- Presence of a manager that contains the business logic and an EventListener.
